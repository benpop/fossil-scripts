# fossil-scripts
Scripts for the [Fossil SCM][1] ([Wikipedia][2]), a distributed version control system.

Currently, all are Bourne shell-compatible scripts and are tested with [Bash][3] and [Dash][4].

The scripts require that [SQLite3][5] ([Wikipedia][6]) is an installed executable and is of a compatible version to the one used by your local copy of Fossil.

## Why are you putting this on GitHub?
Because it's easy to use and has good availability.
